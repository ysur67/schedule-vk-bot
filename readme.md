# VK Bot
Simple bot made on Python<br/>
Based on Django<br/>
Uses longpolling<br/>
### Somewhere I used camelCase instead of snake_case  
I did it, beacause of mine oonga boonga<br/>
And, simply, I don't know how to use OOP at all and in Python, even more so
### There is no "How to install" part
Actually, I don't even know is it really needed. Anyway, somehow and someday I will add it, but I don't know when
# How bot works for now<br/>
The video below isn't the last version of bot, so any changes can be made
